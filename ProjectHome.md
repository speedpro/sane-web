There are already some SANE web interfaces, for example http://sanewi.sourceforge.net .

sane-web is little different from those. As a heavy duty scanner user, I maintained electrical copies of almost all my bills, papers, time sheets and anything scanable. My normal use of scanner is like this:

  * Carry out a lot of documents, normally in A4
  * Start the scan task from a command line
  * sit in front of the scanner, feed with documents, scan documents one by one
  * go back to my terminal, stop the task
  * all scanned documents are ready

My only problem with existing SANE web interfaces is, I do not want to walk around between the scanner and my monitor, they are physically separated.

Simply said, this is a web interface to enable scanning in BATCH.
